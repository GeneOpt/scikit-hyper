========================
Dimensionality reduction
========================

Matrix factorization for feature extraction and hyperspectral denoising. This can be
performed with the module `skhyper.decomposition`.

As of now, the following algorithms have been implemented or will be soon:

- ``PCA``: Principal components analysis - `completed`
- ``KernelPCA``: Kernel principal components analysis - `todo`
- ``ICA``: Independent component analysis - `completed`
- ``NMF``: Non-negative matrix factorization - `completed`
