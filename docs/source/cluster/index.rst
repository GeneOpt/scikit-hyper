Clustering of unlabeled data can be performed with the module `skhyper.cluster`

As of now, the following algorithms have been implemented or will be soon:

- ``KMeans``: K-means clustering - `completed`
- ``AgglomerativeClustering``: Hierarchical clustering - `todo`
- ``DBSCAN``: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise - `todo`
